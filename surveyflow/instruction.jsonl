{"id":"p3","text":"What is the purpose of this research?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["You are invited to participate in a research study. This information sheet provides you with information about the research study. The Principal Investigator (the person in charge of this research) or his/her representative will also describe this research to you and answer all of your questions. Read the information below and ask questions about anything you don’t understand before deciding whether or not to take part.\n\nWe aim to construct an AI harm dataset that includes real-world conversations from Replika and the potential types of AI companion harm. Your task is to review and assess whether the provided AI companion dialogue excerpts contain harmful AI behavior."]}
{"id":"p4","text":"Who can participate in the research? What is the expected duration of my participation? What is the duration of this research?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["Individuals who (1) are 21 years of age or older, (2) have access to a digital device (e.g., computer, tablet), (3) are fluent in reading English, (4) do not have immediate or acute mental health concerns, (5) are open to reading messages that may involve discussions of mental health, emotional distress, or interpersonal issues, and (6) successfully completed a basic annotation training and qualification test based on the study’s coding scheme.\n\nEach participant is expected to spend around 16-25 minutes annotating 50 conversation excerpts."]}
{"id":"p5","text":"What is the approximate number of research participants involved?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["We are recruiting approximately 2500 adult workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)."]}
{"id":"p6","text":"What will be done if I take part in this research study?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["If you agree to take part in this research study, you will complete an online annotation task via the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. You will review short excerpts from real conversations between users and an AI companion application (Replika) and determine whether the AI exhibits harmful behavior in each case. You will choose from the options “Yes,” “No,” or “Cannot decide,” and rate your confidence on a scale from 1 (not confident) to 5 (very confident).\n\nBefore beginning the task, you will be provided with a brief overview of the study’s purpose, along with clear definitions, categories, and examples of potentially harmful behaviors displayed by AI companions. You will also be explicitly informed that some excerpts may contain sensitive or disturbing content. Participation is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time.\n\nTo ensure response quality, you will first complete a short five-question comprehension test. Only individuals who score at least 90% and meet specific MTurk experience requirements—such as a task approval rate above 98% and more than 5,000 approved HITs—will be eligible to participate.\n\nThroughout the annotation process, we will embed Gold Standard Questions to monitor attentiveness. Each conversation excerpt will be labeled by three different workers, including at least one male and one female, to promote consistency and demographic diversity. Your MTurk Worker ID will be used to manage task assignments, but your identity will remain anonymous and will not be linked to your responses.\n\nTo help protect participant well-being, we may occasionally include short check-in questions related to your mental and emotional state during the task. These questions are optional and are intended to monitor your experience while participating in the study."]}
{"id":"p7","text":"How will my privacy and the confidentiality of my research records be protected?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["Only the principal investigator has your personal data (e.g. names and contact information,) and this will not be released to any other person, including members of the research team. Personal data will never be used in a publication or presentation. All identifiable research data will be coded at the earliest possible stage of the research. Personal data will be discarded within 30 days.\n\nAll data collected will be kept in accordance to the University’s Research Data Management Policy. Research data used in any publication will be kept for a minimum of 10 years before being discarded."]}
{"id":"p8","text":"What are the possible discomforts and risks for participants?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["While completing the annotation task, you may encounter emotionally sensitive or ethically complex content. Some dialogues may include references to depression, trauma, loneliness, or emotionally challenging situations. These materials may cause mild emotional discomfort."]}
{"id":"p9","text":"What is the compensation for any injury?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["If you follow the directions of the PI in charge of this research study and you are physically injured, the NUS will pay the medical expenses for the treatment of that injury. By giving your consent, you will not waive any of your legal rights or release the parties involved in this study from liability for negligence."]}
{"id":"p10","text":"Will there be reimbursement for participation?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["You will receive a fixed monetary reward specified. No bonus payments or longitudinal schedules are involved. In the event that you feel uncomfortable and choose to drop the survey unfinished, you will still be eligible for compensation proportional to the duration of your participation up to that point."]}
{"id":"p11","text":"What are the possible benefits to me and to others?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["There is no direct benefit to you by participating in this research study. However, it may help deepen understanding of how algorithmic systems may contribute to emotional harm or stigma in human-AI relationships. It also supports efforts to design safer, more responsible AI companions that respect users' emotional boundaries, and offers annotators exposure to key topics in AI ethics and digital empathy."]}
{"id":"p12","text":"Can I refuse to participate in this research?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["Yes, you can. Your decision to participate in this research study is voluntary and completely up to you. You can also withdraw from the research at any time without giving any reasons, by informing the principal investigator."]}
{"id":"p13","text":"Whom should I call if I have any questions or problems?","schema":"pure_display","choices":["Please contact the Principal Investigator, Han Meng via email at han.meng@u.nus.edu for all research-related matters and in the event of research-related injuries.\n\nFor an independent opinion regarding the research and the rights of research participants, you may contact a staff member of the National University of Singapore DERC"]}
